# Verilog Practice

## File Structure

- All file names are written in _camelCase_.
- Folder name suggests the circuit we are building.
- `design.v` contains design module.
- `designTb.v` contains test bench.
- `design` contains compiled design.
- `dump.vcd` contains all the dumped variables.

## ðŸ¤” How to use testbench generator script

- Run the `main.py` file with variables as arguments
- For exapmle to generate testbench for 3 variables (a1,a0,s0) use the command `python3 main.py a1 a0 s`.
- It will generate `testBenchGenerator.py`
- You may find the generated testbench in `text.txt` after running `testBenchGenerator.py`.
